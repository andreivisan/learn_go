## Installation

[Download and Install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

```bash
$ go version
```

## Hello, GO

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, GO")
}
```

### Running hello.go

There are 2 options to run hello.go:

1. Basic execution (and the simplest way)

```bash
go run hello.go
```

2. Creating and Running Executables

```bash
go build hello.go

./hello
```

## Packages

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package `main`.

### Imports

It's a good practice to group imports into a paranthesized, "factored" import statement.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)
```

### Exported names

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package.

pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

Run the code. Notice the error message.

To fix the error, rename math.pi to math.Pi and try it again.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```

## Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.

Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

Thus `x int, y int` becomes `x, y int`

### Multiple results

A function can return any number of results.

The swap function returns two strings.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

### Named return values

Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.

These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.

A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.

Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.

### Variables

The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.

A var statement can be at package or function level. We see both in this example.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
	var i int
	fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```

A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.

If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```

Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i, j int = 1, 2
	k := 3
	c, python, java := true, false, "no!"

	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```

### Basic types

Go's basic types are

```text
bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
```

The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.

The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/cmplx"
)

var (
	ToBe   bool       = false
	MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
	z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)
}
```

### Zero values

Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.

The zero value is:

    - 0 for numeric types,
    - false for the boolean type, and
    - "" (the empty string) for strings.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int
	var f float64
	var b bool
	var s string
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
```

### Type conversions

The expression T(v) converts the value v to the type T.

Some numeric conversions:

```go
var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)
```

Or, put more simply:

```go
i := 42
f := float64(i)
u := uint(f)
```

Unlike in C, in Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion. Try removing the float64 or uint conversions in the example and see what happens.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	var x, y int = 3, 4
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))
	var z uint = uint(f)
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```

### Constants

Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.

Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.

Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

### Numeric Constants

Numeric constants are high-precision values.

An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.

Try printing needInt(Big) too.

(An int can store at maximum a 64-bit integer, and sometimes less.)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	// Create a huge number by shifting a 1 bit left 100 places.
	// In other words, the binary number that is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.
	Big = 1 << 100
	// Shift it right again 99 places, so we end up with 1<<1, or 2.
	Small = Big >> 99
)

func needInt(x int) int { return x*10 + 1 }
func needFloat(x float64) float64 {
	return x * 0.1
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(needInt(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Big))
}
```

## For

Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.

The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:

	- the init statement: executed before the first iteration
	- the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
	- the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration

The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.

The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.

Note: Unlike other languages like C, Java, or JavaScript there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement and the braces { } are always required.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 0
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		sum += i
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

The init and post statements are optional.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for ; sum < 1000; {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

### For is Go's "while"

At that point you can drop the semicolons: C's while is spelled for in Go.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for sum < 1000 {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

### Forever

If you omit the loop condition it loops forever, so an infinite loop is compactly expressed.

```go
package main

func main() {
	for {
	}
}
```

### If

Go's if statements are like its for loops; the expression need not be surrounded by parentheses ( ) but the braces { } are required.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func sqrt(x float64) string {
	if x < 0 {
		return sqrt(-x) + "i"
	}
	return fmt.Sprint(math.Sqrt(x))
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(sqrt(2), sqrt(-4))
}
```

### If with a short statement

Like for, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.

Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the if.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
	if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
		return v
	}
	return lim
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(
		pow(3, 2, 10),
		pow(3, 3, 20),
	)
}
```

### If and else

Variables declared inside an if short statement are also available inside any of the else blocks.

(Both calls to pow return their results before the call to fmt.Println in main begins.)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
	if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
		return v
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%g >= %g\n", v, lim)
	}
	// can't use v here, though
	return lim
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(
		pow(3, 2, 10),
		pow(3, 3, 20),
	)
}
```

### Switch

A switch statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of if - else statements. It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.

Go's switch is like the one in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP, except that Go only runs the selected case, not all the cases that follow. In effect, the break statement that is needed at the end of each case in those languages is provided automatically in Go. Another important difference is that Go's switch cases need not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Print("Go runs on ")
	switch os := runtime.GOOS; os {
	case "darwin":
		fmt.Println("OS X.")
	case "linux":
		fmt.Println("Linux.")
	default:
		// freebsd, openbsd,
		// plan9, windows...
		fmt.Printf("%s.\n", os)
	}
}
```

#### Switch evaluation order

Switch cases evaluate cases from top to bottom, stopping when a case succeeds.

(For example,

```
switch i {
case 0:
case f():
}
```

does not call f if i==0.)

#### Switch with no condition

Switch without a condition is the same as switch true.

This construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	t := time.Now()
	switch {
	case t.Hour() < 12:
		fmt.Println("Good morning!")
	case t.Hour() < 17:
		fmt.Println("Good afternoon.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Good evening.")
	}
}
```

### Defer

A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("world")

	fmt.Println("hello")
}
```

#### Stacking defers

Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("counting")

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		defer fmt.Println(i)
	}

	fmt.Println("done")
}
```

will return

```
counting
done
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

## Pointers

Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.

The type *T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.

```
var p *int
```

The & operator generates a pointer to its operand.

```
i := 42
p = &i
```

The * operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.

```
fmt.Println(*p) // read i through the pointer p
*p = 21         // set i through the pointer p
```

This is known as "dereferencing" or "indirecting".

Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.

## Structs

A struct is a collection of fields.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Vertex{1, 2})
}
```

### Struct Fields

Struct fields are accessed using a dot.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X init
	Y int
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{1, 2}
	v.X = 4
	fmt.Println(v.X)
}
```

### Pointers to structs

Struct fields can be accessed through a struct pointer.

To access the field X of a struct when we have the struct pointer p we could write (*p).X. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just p.X, without the explicit dereference.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{1, 2}
	p := &v
	p.X = 1e9
	fmt.Println(v)
}
```

### Struct Literals

A struct literal denotes a newly allocated struct value by listing the values of its fields.

You can list just a subset of fields by using the Name: syntax. (And the order of named fields is irrelevant.)

The special prefix & returns a pointer to the struct value.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y int
}

var (
	v1 = Vertex{1, 2}  // has type Vertex
	v2 = Vertex{X: 1}  // Y:0 is implicit
	v3 = Vertex{}      // X:0 and Y:0
	p  = &Vertex{1, 2} // has type *Vertex
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(v1, p, v2, v3)
}
```

## Arrays

The type [n]T is an array of n values of type T.

The expression

```
var a [10]int
```

declares a variable a as an array of ten integers.

An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized. This seems limiting, but don't worry; Go provides a convenient way of working with arrays.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a [2]string
	a[0] = "Hello"
	a[1] = "World"
	fmt.Println(a[0], a[1])
	fmt.Println(a)

	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
	fmt.Println(primes)
}
```

### Slices

An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.

The type []T is a slice with elements of type T.

A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated by a colon:

```
a[low : high]
```

This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes the last one.

The following expression creates a slice which includes elements 1 through 3 of a:

```
a[1:4]
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}

	var s []int = primes[1:4]
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

Slices are like references to arrays

A slice does not store any data, it just describes a section of an underlying array.

Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.

Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	names := [4]string{
		"John",
		"Paul",
		"George",
		"Ringo",
	}
	fmt.Println(names)

	a := names[0:2]
	b := names[1:3]
	fmt.Println(a, b)

	b[0] = "XXX"
	fmt.Println(a, b)
	fmt.Println(names)
}
```

will print

```
[John Paul George Ringo]
[John Paul] [Paul George]
[John XXX] [XXX George]
[John XXX George Ringo]
```

#### Slice defaults

When slicing, you may omit the high or low bounds to use their defaults instead.

The default is zero for the low bound and the length of the slice for the high bound.

For the array

```
var a [10]int
```

these slice expressions are equivalent:

```
a[0:10]
a[:10]
a[0:]
a[:]
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}

	s = s[1:4]
	fmt.Println(s)

	s = s[:2]
	fmt.Println(s)

	s = s[1:]
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

#### Slice length and capacity

A slice has both a length and a capacity.

The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.

The length and capacity of a slice s can be obtained using the expressions len(s) and cap(s).

You can extend a slice's length by re-slicing it, provided it has sufficient capacity. Try changing one of the slice operations in the example program to extend it beyond its capacity and see what happens.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
	printSlice(s)

	// Slice the slice to give it zero length.
	s = s[:0]
	printSlice(s)

	// Extend its length.
	s = s[1:4]
	printSlice(s)

	// Drop its first two values.
	s = s[2:]
	printSlice(s)
}

func printSlice(s []int) {
	fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s)
}
```

will print

```
len=6 cap=6 [2 3 5 7 11 13]
len=0 cap=6 []
len=3 cap=5 [3 5 7]
len=1 cap=3 [7]
```

#### Nil slices

The zero value of a slice is nil.

A nil slice has a length and capacity of 0 and has no underlying array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var s []int
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s))
	if s == nil {
		fmt.Println("nil!")
	}
}
```

#### Creating a slice with make
Slices can be created with the built-in make function; this is how you create dynamically-sized arrays.

The make function allocates a zeroed array and returns a slice that refers to that array:

```
a := make([]int, 5)  // len(a)=5
```

To specify a capacity, pass a third argument to make:

```
b := make([]int, 0, 5) // len(b)=0, cap(b)=5

b = b[:cap(b)] // len(b)=5, cap(b)=5
b = b[1:]      // len(b)=4, cap(b)=4
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := make([]int, 5)
	printSlice("a", a)

	b := make([]int, 0, 5)
	printSlice("b", b)

	c := b[:2]
	printSlice("c", c)

	d := c[2:5]
	printSlice("d", d)
}

func printSlice(s string, x []int) {
	fmt.Printf("%s len=%d cap=%d %v\n",
		s, len(x), cap(x), x)
}
```

Slices can contain any type, including other slices.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// Create a tic-tac-toe board.
	board := [][]string{
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
	}

	// The players take turns.
	board[0][0] = "X"
	board[2][2] = "O"
	board[1][2] = "X"
	board[1][0] = "O"
	board[0][2] = "X"

	for i := 0; i < len(board); i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%s\n", strings.Join(board[i], " "))
	}
}
```

will return

```
X _ X
O _ X
_ _ O
```

#### Slice internals

A slice is a descriptor of an array segment. It consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the segment, and its capacity (the maximum length of the segment).

#### A possible “gotcha”

As mentioned earlier, re-slicing a slice doesn’t make a copy of the underlying array. The full array will be kept in memory until it is no longer referenced. Occasionally this can cause the program to hold all the data in memory when only a small piece of it is needed.

For example, this FindDigits function loads a file into memory and searches it for the first group of consecutive numeric digits, returning them as a new slice.

```go
var digitRegexp = regexp.MustCompile("[0-9]+")

func FindDigits(filename string) []byte {
    b, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
    return digitRegexp.Find(b)
}
```

This code behaves as advertised, but the returned []byte points into an array containing the entire file. Since the slice references the original array, as long as the slice is kept around the garbage collector can’t release the array; the few useful bytes of the file keep the entire contents in memory.

To fix this problem one can copy the interesting data to a new slice before returning it:

```go
func CopyDigits(filename string) []byte {
    b, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
    b = digitRegexp.Find(b)
    c := make([]byte, len(b))
    copy(c, b)
    return c
}
```

A more concise version of this function could be constructed by using append.

### Range

The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.

When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a copy of the element at that index.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var pow = []int{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}

func main() {
	for i, v := range pow {
		fmt.Printf("2**%d = %d\n", i, v)
	}
}
```

will print

```
2**0 = 1
2**1 = 2
2**2 = 4
2**3 = 8
2**4 = 16
2**5 = 32
2**6 = 64
2**7 = 128
```

You can skip the index or value by assigning to _.

```
for i, _ := range pow
for _, value := range pow
```

If you only want the index, you can omit the second variable.

```
for i := range pow
```

##  Maps

A map maps keys to values.

The zero value of a map is nil. A nil map has no keys, nor can keys be added.

The make function returns a map of the given type, initialized and ready for use.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	Lat, Long float64
}

var m map[string]Vertex

func main() {
	m = make(map[string]Vertex)
	m["Bell Labs"] = Vertex{
		40.68433, -74.39967,
	}
	fmt.Println(m["Bell Labs"])
}
```

###  Map literals

Map literals are like struct literals, but the keys are required.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	Lat, Long float64
}

var m = map[string]Vertex{
	"Bell Labs": Vertex{
		40.68433, -74.39967,
	},
	"Google": Vertex{
		37.42202, -122.08408,
	},
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(m)
}
```

If the top-level type is just a type name, you can omit it from the elements of the literal.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	Lat, Long float64
}

var m = map[string]Vertex{

### Mutating Maps

Insert or update an element in map m:

```
m[key] = elem
```

Retrieve an element:

```
elem = m[key]
```

Delete an element:

```
delete(m, key)
```

Test that a key is present with a two-value assignment:

```
elem, ok = m[key]
```

If key is in m, ok is true. If not, ok is false.

If key is not in the map, then elem is the zero value for the map's element type.

Note: If elem or ok have not yet been declared you could use a short declaration form:

```
elem, ok := m[key]
```

## Function values

Functions are values too. They can be passed around just like other values.

Function values may be used as function arguments and return values.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func compute(fn func(float64, float64) float64) float64 {
	return fn(3, 4)
}

func main() {
	hypot := func(x, y float64) float64 {
		return math.Sqrt(x*x + y*y)
	}
	fmt.Println(hypot(5, 12))

	fmt.Println(compute(hypot))
	fmt.Println(compute(math.Pow))
}
```

## Function closures

Go functions may be closures. A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables; in this sense the function is "bound" to the variables.

For example, the adder function returns a closure. Each closure is bound to its own sum variable.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func adder() func(int) int {
	sum := 0
	return func(x int) int {
		sum += x
		return sum
	}
}

func main() {
	pos, neg := adder(), adder()
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println(
			pos(i),
			neg(-2*i),
		)
	}
}
```

will return 

```
0 0
1 -2
3 -6
6 -12
10 -20
15 -30
21 -42
28 -56
36 -72
45 -90
```

## Methods

Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types.

A method is a function with a special receiver argument.

The receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the method name.

In this example, the Abs method has a receiver of type Vertex named v.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
}
```

You can declare a method on non-struct types, too.

In this example we see a numeric type MyFloat with an Abs method.

You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method. You cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another package (which includes the built-in types such as int).

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type MyFloat float64

func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
	if f < 0 {
		return float64(-f)
	}
	return float64(f)
}

func main() {
	f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
	fmt.Println(f.Abs())
}
```

### Pointer receivers

You can declare methods with pointer receivers.

This means the receiver type has the literal syntax *T for some type T. (Also, T cannot itself be a pointer such as *int.)

For example, the Scale method here is defined on *Vertex.

Methods with pointer receivers can modify the value to which the receiver points (as Scale does here). Since methods often need to modify their receiver, pointer receivers are more common than value receivers.

Try removing the * from the declaration of the Scale function on line 16 and observe how the program's behavior changes. It will return 5 instead of 50 since Scale won't modify the receiver. So that is the difference between pass by value and pass by reference.

With a value receiver, the Scale method operates on a copy of the original Vertex value. (This is the same behavior as for any other function argument.) The Scale method must have a pointer receiver to change the Vertex value declared in the main function.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	v.Scale(10)
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
}
```

### Methods and pointer indirection

Comparing the previous two programs, you might notice that functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer:

```
var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK
```

while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```
var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK
```

For the statement v.Scale(5), even though v is a value and not a pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically. That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement v.Scale(5) as (&v).Scale(5) since the Scale method has a pointer receiver.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func ScaleFunc(v *Vertex, f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	v.Scale(2)
	ScaleFunc(&v, 10)

	p := &Vertex{4, 3}
	p.Scale(3)
	ScaleFunc(p, 8)

	fmt.Println(v, p)
}
```

The equivalent thing happens in the reverse direction.

Functions that take a value argument must take a value of that specific type:

```
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))  // OK
fmt.Println(AbsFunc(&v)) // Compile error!
```

while methods with value receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

```
var v Vertex
fmt.Println(v.Abs()) // OK
p := &v
fmt.Println(p.Abs()) // OK
```

In this case, the method call p.Abs() is interpreted as (*p).Abs().

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func AbsFunc(v Vertex) float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
	fmt.Println(AbsFunc(v))

	p := &Vertex{4, 3}
	fmt.Println(p.Abs())
	fmt.Println(AbsFunc(*p))
}
```

### Choosing a value or pointer receiver

There are two reasons to use a pointer receiver.

The first is so that the method can modify the value that its receiver points to.

The second is to avoid copying the value on each method call. This can be more efficient if the receiver is a large struct, for example.

In this example, both Scale and Abs are methods with receiver type *Vertex, even though the Abs method needn't modify its receiver.

In general, all methods on a given type should have either value or pointer receivers, but not a mixture of both. (We'll see why over the next few pages.)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func (v *Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := &Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Printf("Before scaling: %+v, Abs: %v\n", v, v.Abs())
	v.Scale(5)
	fmt.Printf("After scaling: %+v, Abs: %v\n", v, v.Abs())
}
```

## Interfaces

An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures.

A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

Note: There is an error in the example code on line 22. Vertex (the value type) doesn't implement Abser because the Abs method is defined only on *Vertex (the pointer type).

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Abser interface {
	Abs() float64
}

func main() {
	var a Abser
	f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
	v := Vertex{3, 4}

	a = f  // a MyFloat implements Abser
	a = &v // a *Vertex implements Abser

	// In the following line, v is a Vertex (not *Vertex)
	// and does NOT implement Abser.
	a = v

	fmt.Println(a.Abs())
}

type MyFloat float64

func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
	if f < 0 {
		return float64(-f)
	}
	return float64(f)
}

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v *Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}
```

###  Interfaces are implemented implicitly

A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.

Implicit interfaces decouple the definition of an interface from its implementation, which could then appear in any package without prearrangement.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type I interface {
	M()
}

type T struct {
	S string
}

// This method means type T implements the interface I,
// but we don't need to explicitly declare that it does so.
func (t T) M() {
	fmt.Println(t.S)
}

func main() {
	var i I = T{"hello"}
	i.M()
}
```

###  Interface values

Under the hood, interface values can be thought of as a tuple of a value and a concrete type:

(value, type)
An interface value holds a value of a specific underlying concrete type.

Calling a method on an interface value executes the method of the same name on its underlying type.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type I interface {
	M()
}

type T struct {
	S string
}

func (t *T) M() {
	fmt.Println(t.S)
}

type F float64

func (f F) M() {
	fmt.Println(f)
}

func main() {
	var i I

	i = &T{"Hello"}
	describe(i)
	i.M()

	i = F(math.Pi)
	describe(i)
	i.M()
}

func describe(i I) {
	fmt.Printf("(%v, %T)\n", i, i)
}
```

### Interface values with nil underlying values

If the concrete value inside the interface itself is nil, the method will be called with a nil receiver.

In some languages this would trigger a null pointer exception, but in Go it is common to write methods that gracefully handle being called with a nil receiver (as with the method M in this example.)

Note that an interface value that holds a nil concrete value is itself non-nil.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type I interface {
	M()
}

type T struct {
	S string
}

func (t *T) M() {
	if t == nil {
		fmt.Println("<nil>")
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(t.S)
}

func main() {
	var i I

	var t *T
	i = t
	describe(i)
	i.M()

	i = &T{"hello"}
	describe(i)
	i.M()
}

func describe(i I) {
	fmt.Printf("(%v, %T)\n", i, i)
}
```

### Nil interface values

A nil interface value holds neither value nor concrete type.

Calling a method on a nil interface is a run-time error because there is no type inside the interface tuple to indicate which concrete method to call.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type I interface {
	M()
}

func main() {
	var i I
	describe(i)
	i.M()
}

func describe(i I) {
	fmt.Printf("(%v, %T)\n", i, i)
}
```

### The empty interface

The interface type that specifies zero methods is known as the empty interface:

```
interface{}
```

An empty interface may hold values of any type. (Every type implements at least zero methods.)

Empty interfaces are used by code that handles values of unknown type. For example, fmt.Print takes any number of arguments of type interface{}.

### Type assertions

A type assertion provides access to an interface value's underlying concrete value.

```
t := i.(T)
```

This statement asserts that the interface value i holds the concrete type T and assigns the underlying T value to the variable t.

If i does not hold a T, the statement will trigger a panic.

To test whether an interface value holds a specific type, a type assertion can return two values: the underlying value and a boolean value that reports whether the assertion succeeded.

```
t, ok := i.(T)
```

If i holds a T, then t will be the underlying value and ok will be true.

If not, ok will be false and t will be the zero value of type T, and no panic occurs.

Note the similarity between this syntax and that of reading from a map.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i interface{} = "hello"

	s := i.(string)
	fmt.Println(s)

	s, ok := i.(string)
	fmt.Println(s, ok)

	f, ok := i.(float64)
	fmt.Println(f, ok)

	f = i.(float64) // panic
	fmt.Println(f)
}
```

will return 

```
hello
hello true
0 false
panic: interface conversion: interface {} is string, not float64

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.main()
	/tmp/sandbox976713470/prog.go:17 +0x14f
```

### Type switches

A type switch is a construct that permits several type assertions in series.

A type switch is like a regular switch statement, but the cases in a type switch specify types (not values), and those values are compared against the type of the value held by the given interface value.

```
switch v := i.(type) {
case T:
    // here v has type T
case S:
    // here v has type S
default:
    // no match; here v has the same type as i
}
```

The declaration in a type switch has the same syntax as a type assertion i.(T), but the specific type T is replaced with the keyword type.

This switch statement tests whether the interface value i holds a value of type T or S. In each of the T and S cases, the variable v will be of type T or S respectively and hold the value held by i. In the default case (where there is no match), the variable v is of the same interface type and value as i.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func do(i interface{}) {
	switch v := i.(type) {
	case int:
		fmt.Printf("Twice %v is %v\n", v, v*2)
	case string:
		fmt.Printf("%q is %v bytes long\n", v, len(v))
	default:
		fmt.Printf("I don't know about type %T!\n", v)
	}
}

func main() {
	do(21)
	do("hello")
	do(true)
}
```

will return 

```
Twice 21 is 42
"hello" is 5 bytes long
I don't know about type bool!
```

###  Stringers
One of the most ubiquitous interfaces is Stringer defined by the fmt package.

```
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}
```

A Stringer is a type that can describe itself as a string. The fmt package (and many others) look for this interface to print values.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func (p Person) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%v (%v years)", p.Name, p.Age)
}

func main() {
	a := Person{"Arthur Dent", 42}
	z := Person{"Zaphod Beeblebrox", 9001}
	fmt.Println(a, z)
}
```

### Errors

Go programs express error state with error values.

The error type is a built-in interface similar to fmt.Stringer:

```
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
```

(As with fmt.Stringer, the fmt package looks for the error interface when printing values.)

Functions often return an error value, and calling code should handle errors by testing whether the error equals nil.

```
i, err := strconv.Atoi("42")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("couldn't convert number: %v\n", err)
    return
}
fmt.Println("Converted integer:", i)
```

A nil error denotes success; a non-nil error denotes failure.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

type MyError struct {
	When time.Time
	What string
}

func (e *MyError) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("at %v, %s",
		e.When, e.What)
}

func run() error {
	return &MyError{
		time.Now(),
		"it didn't work",
	}
}

func main() {
	if err := run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```

If we pass the pointer *MyError then only this type will have satisfied the error interface. If I pass MyError, both the reference (&) and the value will have satisfied the 
error interface.

## Readers

The io package specifies the io.Reader interface, which represents the read end of a stream of data.

The Go standard library contains many implementations of this interface, including files, network connections, compressors, ciphers, and others.

The io.Reader interface has a Read method:

```
func (T) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Read populates the given byte slice with data and returns the number of bytes populated and an error value. It returns an io.EOF error when the stream ends.

The example code creates a strings.Reader and consumes its output 8 bytes at a time.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	r := strings.NewReader("Hello, Reader!")

	b := make([]byte, 8)
	for {
		n, err := r.Read(b)
		fmt.Printf("n = %v err = %v b = %v\n", n, err, b)
		fmt.Printf("b[:n] = %q\n", b[:n])
		if err == io.EOF {
			break
		}
	}
}
```

## Images

Package image defines the Image interface:

```
package image

type Image interface {
    ColorModel() color.Model
    Bounds() Rectangle
    At(x, y int) color.Color
}
```

Note: the Rectangle return value of the Bounds method is actually an image.Rectangle, as the declaration is inside package image.

(See the documentation for all the details.)

The color.Color and color.Model types are also interfaces, but we'll ignore that by using the predefined implementations color.RGBA and color.RGBAModel. These interfaces and types are specified by the image/color package

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"image"
)

func main() {
	m := image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, 100, 100))
	fmt.Println(m.Bounds())
	fmt.Println(m.At(0, 0).RGBA())
}
```

## Generics

### Type parameters

Go functions can be written to work on multiple types using type parameters. The type parameters of a function appear between brackets, before the function's arguments.

```
func Index[T comparable](s []T, x T) int
```

This declaration means that s is a slice of any type T that fulfills the built-in constraint comparable. x is also a value of the same type.

```comparable``` is a useful constraint that makes it possible to use the == and != operators on values of the type. In this example, we use it to compare a value to all slice elements until a match is found. This Index function works for any type that supports comparison.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Index returns the index of x in s, or -1 if not found.
func Index[T comparable](s []T, x T) int {
	for i, v := range s {
		// v and x are type T, which has the comparable
		// constraint, so we can use == here.
		if v == x {
			return i
		}
	}
	return -1
}

func main() {
	// Index works on a slice of ints
	si := []int{10, 20, 15, -10}
	fmt.Println(Index(si, 15))

	// Index also works on a slice of strings
	ss := []string{"foo", "bar", "baz"}
	fmt.Println(Index(ss, "hello"))
}
```

### Generic types

In addition to generic functions, Go also supports generic types. A type can be parameterized with a type parameter, which could be useful for implementing generic data structures.

This example demonstrates a simple type declaration for a singly-linked list holding any type of value.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// List represents a singly-linked list that holds
// values of any type.
type List[T any] struct {
	next *List[T]
	val  T
}

func main() {
	node_3 := &List[int]{nil, 3}
	node_2 := &List[int]{node_3, 2}
	node_1 := &List[int]{node_2, 1}
	
	current_node := node_1
	for current_node != nil {
		fmt.Println(current_node)
		current_node = current_node.next
	}
}
```

- Once you specify a type parameter T, all instances of List[T] must use the same T.

- The next pointer in List[T] must point to *List[T], meaning the next node must have the same type T.

## Goroutines

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

```
go f(x, y, z)
```

starts a new goroutine running

```
f(x, y, z)
```

The evaluation of f, x, y, and z happens in the current goroutine and the execution of f happens in the new goroutine.

Goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must be synchronized. The sync package provides useful primitives, although you won't need them much in Go as there are other primitives. (See the next slide.)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
```

## Channels

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, <-.

```
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
           // assign value to v.
```

(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.)

Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use:

```
ch := make(chan int)
```

By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

The example code sums the numbers in a slice, distributing the work between two goroutines. Once both goroutines have completed their computation, it calculates the final result.

### Buffered Channels

Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel:

```
ch := make(chan int, 100)
```

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

If the buffered is overfilled it throws a deadlock error.

### Range and Close

A sender can close a channel to indicate that no more values will be sent. Receivers can test whether a channel has been closed by assigning a second parameter to the receive expression: after

```
v, ok := <-ch
```

ok is false if there are no more values to receive and the channel is closed.

The loop for i := range c receives values from the channel repeatedly until it is closed.

**Note:** Only the sender should close a channel, never the receiver. Sending on a closed channel will cause a panic.

**Another note:** Channels aren't like files; you don't usually need to close them. Closing is only necessary when the receiver must be told there are no more values coming, such as to terminate a range loop.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func fibonacci(n int, c chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		c <- x
		x, y = y, x+y
	}
	close(c)
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 10)
	go fibonacci(cap(c), c)
	for i := range c {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

### Select

The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations. This means that we can listen to multiple channels in the same time and which one is ready first is the one that will be executed.

A select blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func fibonacci(c, quit chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for {
		select {
		case c <- x:
			x, y = y, x+y
		case <-quit:
			fmt.Println("quit")
			return
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	quit := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			fmt.Println(<-c)
		}
		quit <- 0
	}()
	fibonacci(c, quit)
}
```

In the example above we use an anonymous functions to start a go routine that writes to the channel in the same time
as the main function reads from the channel through the fibonacci function. Like this, the write and read operations are running concurrently. Otherwise if this happens sequentially, the program would block because the main function would wait for the fibonacci function to finish writing to the channel before it can read from it. This is causing a deadlock.

So, nothing is stored in the channel. The channel is just like a queue that synchronizes back the go routines.
If we want to store, we use buffered channels.

### Synchronization Between Goroutines

Order of Operations Matters:

- First, we create the channels.

- Second, we start the receiver goroutine, which immediately begins waiting to receive values from c.

- Third, we call the fibonacci function, which starts sending values to c.

Avoiding Blocking in fibonacci:

If we called fibonacci before starting the receiver goroutine, fibonacci would attempt to send to c but would block because no goroutine is ready to receive.

### Default Selection

The default case in a select is run if no other case is ready.

Use a default case to try a send or receive without blocking:

```
select {
case i := <-c:
    // use i
default:
    // receiving from c would block
}
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	tick := time.Tick(100 * time.Millisecond)
	boom := time.After(500 * time.Millisecond)
	for {
		select {
		case <-tick:
			fmt.Println("tick.")
		case <-boom:
			fmt.Println("BOOM!")
			return
		default:
			fmt.Println("    .")
			time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
		}
	}
}
```

will print

```
tick.
    .
    .
tick.
    .
    .
tick.
    .
    .
tick.
    .
    .
tick.
BOOM!
```

## sync.Mutex

We've seen how channels are great for communication among goroutines.

But what if we don't need communication? What if we just want to make sure only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts?

This concept is called mutual exclusion, and the conventional name for the data structure that provides it is mutex.

Go's standard library provides mutual exclusion with sync.Mutex and its two methods:

```
Lock
Unlock
```

We can define a block of code to be executed in mutual exclusion by surrounding it with a call to Lock and Unlock as shown on the Inc method.

We can also use defer to ensure the mutex will be unlocked as in the Value method.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// SafeCounter is safe to use concurrently.
type SafeCounter struct {
	mu sync.Mutex
	v  map[string]int
}

// Inc increments the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Inc(key string) {
	c.mu.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	c.v[key]++
	c.mu.Unlock()
}

// Value returns the current value of the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Value(key string) int {
	c.mu.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	return c.v[key]
}

func main() {
	c := SafeCounter{v: make(map[string]int)}
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		go c.Inc("somekey")
	}

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println(c.Value("somekey"))
}
```

## Testing

Writing a test is just like writing a function, with a few rules

- It needs to be in a file with a name like xxx_test.go

- The test function must start with the word Test

- The test function takes one argument only t *testing.T

- To use the *testing.T type, you need to import "testing", like we did with fmt in the other file

For now, it's enough to know that your t of type *testing.T is your "hook" into the testing framework so you can do things like t.Fail() when you want to fail.

For helper functions, it's a good idea to accept a testing.TB which is an interface that *testing.T and *testing.B both satisfy, so you can call helper functions from a test, or a benchmark (don't worry if words like "interface" mean nothing to you right now, it will be covered later).

t.Helper() is needed to tell the test suite that this method is a helper. By doing this, when it fails, the line number reported will be in our function call rather than inside our test helper. This will help other developers track down problems more easily.

## Named return value

In our function signature we have made a named return value (prefix string).

This will create a variable called prefix in your function.

- It will be assigned the "zero" value. This depends on the type, for example ints are 0 and for strings it is "".

  - You can return whatever it's set to by just calling return rather than return prefix.

  - This will display in the Go Doc for your function so it can make the intent of your code clearer.

default in the switch case will be branched to if none of the other case statements match.

The function name starts with a lowercase letter. In Go, public functions start with a capital letter, and private ones start with a lowercase letter. We don't want the internals of our algorithm exposed to the world, so we made this function private.

Example functions are compiled whenever tests are executed. Because such examples are validated by the Go compiler, you can be confident your documentation's examples always reflect current code behavior.

Notice the special format of the comment, // Output: 6. While the example will always be compiled, adding this comment means the example will also be executed. Go ahead and temporarily remove the comment // Output: 6, then run go test, and you will see ExampleAdd is no longer executed.

## Benchmarking

Writing benchmarks in Go is another first-class feature of the language and it is very similar to writing tests.

```go
func BenchmarkRepeat(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		Repeat("a")
	}
}
```

The testing.B gives you access to the cryptically named b.N.

When the benchmark code is executed, it runs b.N times and measures how long it takes.

The amount of times the code is run shouldn't matter to you, the framework will determine what is a "good" value for that to let you have some decent results.

To run the benchmarks do go test -bench=. (or if you're in Windows Powershell go test -bench=".")
